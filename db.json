  "1": "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It relies on algorithms that identify patterns in data and make decisions or predictions based on those patterns. ML is rooted in computer science and statistics, combining principles from both to achieve data-driven automation.",
  "2": "There are three primary types of ML: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data comes with correct output examples. This helps the model learn to generalize from known cases to unseen ones. In contrast, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, aiming to find hidden structures or groupings. Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward through trial and error.",
  "3": "Common algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and k-nearest neighbors. These algorithms are used in various applications like spam detection, recommendation systems, image recognition, and natural language processing.Training an ML model involves feeding it data, selecting a model, optimizing it using a loss function, and evaluating performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Real-world ML systems also require data preprocessing, feature selection, and regularization to prevent overfitting.Overall, ML is transforming industries by automating complex tasks, enabling better decision-making, and unlocking insights from vast datasets."
